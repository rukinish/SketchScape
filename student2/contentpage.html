              The art of generating movement in a two-dimensional environment is
              known as 2D animation. This covers backdrops, creatures, FX, and
              characters.The popular and versatile medium of 2D animation is
              experiencing a huge resurgence. It is widely used in TV shows,
              video games, movies, commercials, mobile apps, and websites.From
              pencil and paper hand-drawn processes to the use of digital
              approaches using computer tools like Toon Boom Harmony or Adobe
              After Effects, 2D creation has developed. <br />
              <br />
              To create a 2D animation, a large number of images are assembled
              into a sequence that gives the impression of movement and action.
              "The technique of filming successive drawings or positions of
              puppets or models to create the appearance of movement when the
              movie is exhibited as a sequence" is how these kinds of animation
              are described.<br />
              <br />
              Unlike in 3D animation, objects in 2D animation move up, down,
              left, and right but not toward or away from the camera.2D
              animation is divided into three parts. They are
              pre-production,production and post production. Each of them is
              divided into many catergories.

            <p>
              2D animation was developed in the late 1800s, It is a time-honored
              animation method. In the past, artists have traditionally drawn
              each frame using pencils before painting the designs onto cells,
              which are sheets of clear plastic. These cells were later each
              individually imaged.<br />
              <br />
              Drawing a picture, then drawing another one near to it while
              keeping the change very slight is the history of 2D animation. To
              build a scenario, hundreds of drawings were done, starting with
              the first and ending with the last. To get the desired outcome,
              this method is then demonstrated in a prompt sequence.These days,
              we have more suitable computer software, which has helped to
              simplify this process. 2D animation makes it possible to
              illustrate ideas in more detail and creativity. Basically, 2D
              animation has advanced significantly. From Fantasmagorie in 1908
              up until the present, there have been many cartoons and flash
              animations.

          </div>

          <p class="about-techniques">
            There are many techniques used in 2D animation. Some of them are
            Cut-out , Rotoscoping, Digital , Flash and many more. Firstly , The
            cut-out animation is a technique done using paper or other
            materials, flat, 2D characters and objects are created, then moved
            around on a flat surface. The animation is then produced by filming
            and replaying the actions. Secondly,Using Digital animation 2D
            animations are made with software. Using a mouse or digital drawing
            pad, the animator creates the characters and objects, and the
            program fills in the missing frames to produce the animation. <br />
            <br />
            Further,Flash animation is a digital animation that makes use of
            Adobe Flash technology. Because Flash animation is simple to
            integrate in websites and has a tiny file size, it is frequently
            utilized for web-based animations.Moreover, In Rotoscoping, To
            generate a 2D animation using this method, live-action video is
            traced over frame by frame. Although it takes time, this method may
            produce incredibly lifelike movements. Finally,Traditional
            hand-drawn animation is the most popular method in 2D animation. To
            give the appearance of movement, each frame is manually drawn before
            being photographed one at a time and played back quickly.
