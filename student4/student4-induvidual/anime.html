              The history of Japanese animation, often known as anime, is rich
              and intriguing, going all the way back to the first decade of the
              20th century. A brief propaganda video produced by the Japanese
              government during World War I, the first known animated film in
              Japan debuted in 1917. Early anime examples incorporated
              conventional Japanese folklore and narrative techniques as it
              matured and progressed over the ensuing decades.<br />
              <br />
              Anime grew in popularity during the 1960s and 1970s, both in Japan
              and abroad. At this time, classic programs like "Astro Boy" and
              "Speed Racer" were produced, and they contributed to the
              development of anime as a distinctive and dynamic visual form. The
              popularity of anime grew throughout the 1980s and 1990s as a
              greater variety of genres and themes were explored. The latest
              anime episodes, films, and merchandise are enjoyed by millions of
              fans worldwide, making anime a significant cultural product for
              Japan today.

          <p class="about-techniques">
            Japanese animation, or anime, differs from other types of animation
            in that it has a distinctive visual aesthetic. The use of
            exaggerated facial expressions and gestures to portray emotion and
            mood is one of anime's most distinctive characteristics. Another
            method utilized in anime to convey movement and action is the use of
            dynamic camera angles and fast cuts. <br />
            <br />
            Also, anime is renowned for its distinctive character designs, which
            frequently include big eyes, vibrant hair, and stylized attire.
            These visual elements contribute to the visual appeal of the genre
            as a whole and aid in making anime characters easily recognizable.
            Moreover, anime frequently has elaborate backgrounds and finely
            drawn environments, which can enhance the animation's impression of
            depth and reality. <br />
            <br />
            Overall, the methods used in Japanese animation have contributed to
            its popularity and influence both in Japan and beyond. From its
            distinctive visual aesthetic to its compelling plots and characters,
            anime never ceases to enthrall viewers and motivate new generations
            of creators.
